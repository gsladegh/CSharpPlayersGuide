 *  Boss Battle Rock-Paper-Scissors 150 XP
    The first design pedestal requires you to provide an object-oriented design—a set of objects, classes, 
    and how they interact—for the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, described below:

    • Two human players compete against each other.
    • Each player picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    • Depending on the players’ choices, a winner is determined: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, 
    Paper beats Rock. If both players pick the same option, it is a draw.
    • The game must display who won the round.
    • The game will keep running rounds until the window is closed but must remember the historical 
    record of how many times each player won and how many draws there were

// I guess this is just a thought exercise

// enumeration for paper, rock, scissors?
// tracker class or method of win loss that saves to file or database
// score class
// person class
