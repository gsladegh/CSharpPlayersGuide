    Challenge Repairing the Clocktower 100 XP

    The recent attacks damaged the great Clocktower of Consolas. The citizens of Consolas have repaired 
    most of it, except one piece that requires the steady hand of a Programmer. It is the part that makes the 
    clock tick and tock. Numbers flow into the clock to make it go, and if the number is even, the clock’s 
    pendulum should tick to the left; if the number is odd, the pendulum should tock to the right. Only a 
    programmer can recreate this critical clock element to make it work again.

    Objectives:
    • Take a number as input from the console.
    • Display the word “Tick” if the number is even. Display the word “Tock” if the number is odd.
    • Hint: Remember that you can use the remainder operator to determine if a number is even or odd.

Console.Clear();
Console.Write("Enter a clock number: ");
int clockNumber = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

if(clockNumber % 2 == 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Tick");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Tock");
}
