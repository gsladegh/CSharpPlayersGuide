/*
 *  Boss Battle The Password Validator 100 XP
 *  
    The fifth and final pedestal describes a class that represents a concept more abstract than the first four: 
    a password validator. You must create a class that can determine if a password is valid (meets the rules 
    defined for a legitimate password). The pedestal initially doesn’t describe any rules, but as you brush the 
    dust off the pedestal, it vibrates for a moment, and the following rules appear:

    • Passwords must be at least 6 letters long and no more than 13 letters long.
    • Passwords must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. 
 
    • Passwords cannot contain a capital T or an ampersand (&) because Ingelmar in IT has decreed it.
    That last rule seems random, and you wonder if the pedestal is just tormenting you with obscure rules. 
    You ponder for a moment about how to decide if a character is uppercase, lowercase, or a number, but 
    while scratching your head, you notice a piece of folded parchment on the ground near your feet. You 
    pick it up, unfold it, and read it:

    foreach with a string lets you get its characters!
    > foreach (char letter in word) { ... }

    char has static methods to categorize letters!
    > char.IsUpper('A'), char.IsLower('a'), char.IsDigit('0') 

    That might be useful information! You are grateful to whoever left it behind. It is signed simply “A.”
    Objectives:
    • Define a new PasswordValidator class that can be given a password and determine if the 
    password follows the rules above. 
    • Make your main method loop forever, asking for a password and reporting whether the password is 
    allowed using an instance of the PasswordValidator class
