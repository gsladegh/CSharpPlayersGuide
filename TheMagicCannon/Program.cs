/*
 *  Challenge The Magic Cannon 100 XP
 *  
    Skorin, a member of Consolas’s wall guard, has constructed a magic cannon that draws power from two 
    gems: a fire gem and an electric gem. Every third turn of a crank, the fire gem activates, and the cannon 
    produces a fire blast. The electric gem activates every fifth turn of the crank, and the cannon makes an 
    electric blast. When the two line up, it generates a potent combined blast. Skorin would like your help to 
    produce a program that can warn the crew about which turns of the crank will produce the different 
    blasts before they do it.

    A partial output of the desired program looks like this:

    1: Normal
    2: Normal
    3: Fire
    4: Normal
    5: Electric
    6: Fire
    7: Normal 
    ...

    Objectives:

    •   Write a program that will loop through the values between 1 and 100 and display what kind of blast 
        the crew should expect. (The % operator may be of use.)
    •   Change the color of the output based on the type of blast. (For example, red for Fire, yellow for 
        Electric, and blue for Electric and Fire).
